1.1.0
  * General improvements and refactoring of code.
  * Made changes to make the response compatible with the Cavatica system, even though the previous
    response adhered to the DRS specification. The Cavatica system presently requires that the DRS
    servers using the fourth access method, which requires an access_id to be provided and then
    the a URL to the bytes returned from the /access endpoint. The previous version was using
    a completely open model for public data (described as "public content" in the GA4GH DRS
    documentation).
